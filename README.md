## Chat App -- | ReactJs | NodeJs | Socket.io | Redis |

### A real time chat with React, Node, Socket.io and Redis.

### - About

- I developed this project with a simple interface to focus on the web sockets part and communication between front and back in real time.

- The tools I used for this app were ReactJs for the front-end, NodeJs for the back and also Redis to store messages and save as history. The communication between front and back in real time through WebSockets, was done with Socket.io which is an amazing tool, and which makes this approach easy to use.
